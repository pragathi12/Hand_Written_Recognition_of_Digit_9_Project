# Hand_Written_Recognition_of_Digit_9_Project
Developed a CNN model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to identify digit ‘9’ from MNIST. Designed the architecture, used OpenCV for preprocessing, and trained for accurate feature extraction. Built a Tkinter-based real-time interface with error detection for precise classification. Demonstrated expertise in deep learning, image processing, and model deployment.
